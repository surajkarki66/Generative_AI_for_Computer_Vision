# Generative_AI_for_Computer_Vision

## Overview
Welcome to the repository dedicated to exploring Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in Computer Vision. This repository serves as a centralized hub for various projects, research, and resources related to generating visual content using AI models.

## About
Generative AI has gained significant attention recently due to its ability to create realistic and novel content. In Computer Vision, generative models have been employed for tasks such as image synthesis, style transfer, super-resolution, and more. This repository aims to showcase different approaches, algorithms, and applications of Generative AI specifically tailored to the domain of Computer Vision.

## Techniques
Some of the AI techniques for generating images are given below:
#### 1. Autoencoder
#### 2. Variational Autoencoder
#### 3. DeepDream
#### 4. Neural Style Transfer
#### 5. Generative Adversarial Neural Network
#### 6. Stable Diffusion
#### 7. Large Vision Models
